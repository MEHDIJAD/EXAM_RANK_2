C12- Exercise-12:

• Create the function ft_list_remove_if which erases off the list all elements whose
data compared to data_ref with cmp makes cmp to return 0.
• The data from an element that should be erase, should be freed using free_fct
• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_list_remove_if(t_list **begin_list, void *data_ref, int (*cmp)(), void (*free_fct)(void *));

• Function pointed by cmp and by free_fct will be used as follows :

(*cmp)(list_ptr->data, data_ref);
